          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Know A Fence started as a small, family-run fencing crew serving neighbors in West Warwick. Over the years, the company grew through word-of-mouth referrals, one fence and one satisfied customer at a time.</p>
          <p>Today, the team installs and repairs fences across Rhode Island while staying true to the same values: honest pricing, clear communication, and dependable workmanship.</p>
